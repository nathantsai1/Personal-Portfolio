                <h2>About Me</h2>
                <p class="white">My name is Nathan Tsai and I am a freshman at <a href="fhs.fuhsd.org" class="blank">
                    Fremont High School</a>. I am studying computer science and I am interested many academic-like activities, including web-dev, 
                    PCB making, and being challenged with difficult problems - chess, Leetcode in languages I can understand, and using
                    new languages to program in. In terms of non-academic activities, I am a huge fan of running, psychology, and reading spy
                    books like those in the 007 series. Currently, I am trying learn c++ and use the arduino language to understand how to create
                    a keyboard. I enjoy creating unique projects that are difficult to create, so that I can immerse myself into weird languages,
                    and further delve into the complex Internet of Things. Every day, I try to learn something new about me or the world, 
                    or create something that simplifies life. </p>
